The hidden goal of this game is to reveal all the face down cards, otherwise too many moves may become impossible.
It is virtually always correct to make such a move if it does not require using a card from the stock. 

Most of the strategy comes down to manipulating cards in the stock pile.
Early cards in each fresh deal will remain accessible on the next deal as long as cards that came before remain undisturbed.
Thus, it is best to prioritize card moves toward the very end of a deal.

Common Tip: Leave the final card of a stack in place until the empty space can be used immediately.

With only one pass through the deck, there is not a ton of decision making to be done.
Most available moves simply have to be taken.
Reveal as many face down cards as possible and hope for the best!

Most of the skill in this game is empty space management.
If an empty space cannot be formed within ~2 deals the game is likely doomed.

An ideal use of an empty space is to fix multiple tangled stacks while leaving a new empty space left over.
Another great use is to reveal a new card in a pile that is likely to become empty soon.
Otherwise, it is still valuable to use the space to help get the remaining piles in better order.

When dealing, some judgment is required whether or not an empty space is likely to be reopened after being filled by a random card.
If no other stacks are in good shape, it is often better to leave the space open before dealing.

Common Tip: Despite some risk in doing so, it sometimes becomes necessary to move just two suits to the foundations rather than developing evenly.

With only one pass through the deck, it becomes important to move as many cards as possible to the tableau.
But this should not be done carelessly. 

[klondike2]
The addition of two extra piles means that stock manipulation is much less necessary compared to single-deck Klondike.
Most moves can be made without much worry.
It is still advisable to prioritize moves that do not need cards from the stock pile.

Try to uncover aces early in order to start reducing the number of cards in play.

Look for opportunities to clear an entire tableau column.
Common Tip: An empty space can be used to enable movement of large stacks or as a spot to deposit a sequence blocking important cards underneath.

[bakers]
Aim to open up an empty space in a way that requires few free cells, two is a good rule of thumb.
Common Tip: An empty space can be used to enable movement of large stacks or as a spot to deposit a sequence blocking important cards underneath.

Common Tip: Prioritize moving a large number of cards in a single suit to their foundation instead of digging for every Ace.

Look for ways to empty the cells that start filled to enable longer series of moves.

Avoid stacking three or more cards of a given suit on top of lower ranked cards of the same suit, unless there is no other choice.
Six or more cards stacked like this will become impossible to untangle.

[forecell]
Aim to form pure sequences with no other cards beneath, ideally using a King as the base.
Until such sequences are possible, look for piles of relatively unimportant cards to build sequences upon.

Free cells are absolutely vital for success and should be opened whenever possible.
Even without many open cells, long sequences can sometimes be moved in small pieces. 

Aces should be somewhat prioritized when deciding which piles to dig into.

[yukon]
This game is a balancing act of uncovering cards while avoiding the creation of stacks that are impossible to detangle.
For example, placing a stack containing a red 9 on top of a stack containing a black 8. 
There is a second red 9 in the deck so this is not necessarily impossible to fix, just difficult.

Common Tip: Leave the final card of a stack in place until the empty space can be used immediately.
