# Solitaire

Instead of installing a menagerie of solitaire apps for my phone, I developed this progressive web app to support dozens of games in one unified place. And as an added bonus, without ads or in-app purchases!

Other features include: intelligent tap-to-move cards, quick-fill foundation piles, and instructions for every game. Gameplay tips are also included for some games where I felt qualified to comment.

You can play the app on your phone or browser here: https://dowhileluke.github.io/solitaire/
